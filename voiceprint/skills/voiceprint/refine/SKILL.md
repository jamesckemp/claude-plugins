# Voiceprint Refine - Iterative Writer Skill Improvement

Surgically improve an existing writer skill without re-running the full questionnaire. Users discover gaps when using their writer skill in practice - this workflow lets them fix those gaps immediately.

## Mode Check

If plan mode is active, exit it now using ExitPlanMode before starting this workflow. All voiceprint commands run in execute mode.

## Inputs

- **Target directory**: The path provided by the user (via `$ARGUMENTS` from the command). This directory must contain both `SKILL.md` and `voice-profile.md`.

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1: Load & Ask          (~30s)  → Read files silently, ask what to refine
Phase 2: Apply                (~1 min) → Surgical edits to both files
Phase 3: Validate             (~1 min) → Generate test content targeting the change
Phase 4: Cross-Check          (opt)   → Flag inconsistencies against full profile
Phase 5: Summary              (~30s)  → List changes, offer changelog
```

## Phase 1: Load & Ask

### Step 1: Read the target files

Read both files from the provided directory path silently — do NOT display a summary:
- `{TARGET_DIR}/SKILL.md` - The writer skill
- `{TARGET_DIR}/voice-profile.md` - The voice profile

If either file is missing, tell the user:

> I couldn't find a complete writer skill at that path. I need both `SKILL.md` and `voice-profile.md` in the directory. Check the path and try again.

Then stop.

### Step 2: Ask immediately

Do NOT display a profile summary. The user already knows their profile — they're here because something specific needs fixing. Go straight to the question:

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question**: "What would you like to refine about your writer skill?"
- **Options**:
  - "Add forbidden patterns" (description: "New phrases or structures to avoid")
  - "Remove forbidden patterns" (description: "Something was flagged that I actually use")
  - "Adjust tone/formality" (description: "Change how formal, casual, direct, etc.")
  - "Add active patterns" (description: "Phrases or structures I want used more")
  - "Provide a writing example" (description: "Add a new exemplar to the voice profile")
  - "Update content templates" (description: "Change how specific content types are handled")
  - "Something else" (description: "I'll describe what I need")

### Step 3: Get specifics

Based on their selection, ask a follow-up for details.

**For "Add forbidden patterns":**

Ask (free text, not AskUserQuestion):

> What patterns have you noticed that don't sound like you? Give me examples — specific phrases, sentence structures, or general categories. If you've seen them in content generated with your skill, paste an example.

After they respond, read `references/ai-tells.md` from the voiceprint skill directory to check if the pattern falls into an existing category. If it does, offer to add the full category:

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question**: "That falls under '{CATEGORY_NAME}' in the AI tells catalog. Want me to add the full category or just the specific phrases you mentioned?"
- **Options**:
  - "Full category" (description: "Block all {COUNT} phrases in this group")
  - "Just what I mentioned" (description: "Only block the specific phrases")

**For "Remove forbidden patterns":**

List the current items from the Avoid List in SKILL.md and ask which ones to remove.

**For "Adjust tone/formality":**

Ask (free text):

> How would you describe the adjustment? For example: "more casual", "less hedging", "more direct", "allow more humor". You can also paste an example of writing that has the tone you want.

**For "Add active patterns":**

Ask (free text):

> What patterns or phrases do you want used more? Paste examples from your own writing if you have them.

**For "Provide a writing example":**

Ask (free text):

> Paste a writing sample that represents your voice well. Tell me what context it's from (tweet, email, blog post, message, etc.) and I'll add it as an exemplar to your profile.

**For "Update content templates":**

Ask which content template (Social Media, Blog, Email, Documentation) and what to change.

**For "Something else":**

Ask them to describe what they need in free text.

### Step 4: Confirm understanding

Summarize what you're going to change before making edits:

> Here's what I'll do:
>
> {numbered list of specific changes}
>
> Sound right?

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question**: "Proceed with these changes?"
- **Options**:
  - "Yes, go ahead" (description: "Apply the changes")
  - "Let me adjust" (description: "I want to modify the plan")

If they want to adjust, loop back to gather more detail.

---

## Phase 2: Apply Refinements

Make surgical edits to both `SKILL.md` and `voice-profile.md`. These files have overlapping sections that must stay in sync.

### Section Mapping

The same information appears in both files under different headings:

| SKILL.md Section | voice-profile.md Section |
|---|---|
| Voice Exemplars | Writing Exemplars |
| Voice Markers → Signature Moves | (derived from Preferred Patterns) |
| Voice Markers → Natural Expressions | Preferred Patterns → Natural Expressions |
| Voice Markers → Structural Preferences | Preferred Patterns → Structural Preferences |
| Avoid List | Forbidden Patterns (full categorized version) |
| Platform Formats | (use case weighting in Notes) |
| Internal Checks → metrics | Sentence Structure → Metrics |

### Edit Rules

1. **Always edit both files.** If a pattern is added to SKILL.md's Avoid List, it must also appear in voice-profile.md's Forbidden Patterns.
2. **Preserve existing content.** Add to sections, don't replace them (unless explicitly removing something).
3. **Match the formatting.** Follow the existing bullet/list style in each file.
4. **For new exemplars**: Add to both the Voice Exemplars section in SKILL.md and the Writing Exemplars section in voice-profile.md.
5. **For new forbidden patterns**: Add to the flat Avoid List in SKILL.md AND the categorized Forbidden Patterns in voice-profile.md.

### Applying Category Expansions

When adding a forbidden pattern category from `ai-tells.md`:

1. Read `references/ai-tells.md` from the voiceprint skill directory
2. Find the matching category
3. Copy the highest-impact items from that category
4. Add them to the Avoid List in SKILL.md (flat bullets)
5. Add the full category to voice-profile.md's Forbidden Patterns section
6. No checklist items to update — the Internal Checks in SKILL.md scan against the Avoid List automatically

---

## Phase 3: Validate

### Step 1: Generate test content

Write a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) that specifically targets the change made. The goal is to test whether the skill correctly applies the refinement.

Examples:
- If patterns were forbidden: Write about a topic that would naturally tempt those patterns, and verify none appear
- If tone was adjusted: Write in the new tone setting
- If active patterns were added: Write content that uses those patterns
- If an exemplar was added: Write in the same register as the new exemplar

### Step 2: Present and verify

> Here's a test paragraph written with the updated skill. I specifically targeted the area we changed:
>
> {test paragraph}
>
> Does this look right?

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question**: "How does this look?"
- **Options**:
  - "Good" (description: "The change is working as expected")
  - "Needs more adjustment" (description: "I'll tell you what's still off")

If more adjustment is needed, loop back to Phase 1 Step 3 with the additional feedback.

---

## Phase 4: Cross-Check (Optional)

After applying changes, offer to cross-check the updated skill against the full voice profile for consistency.

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question**: "Want me to cross-check your updated skill against the full voice profile for any inconsistencies?"
- **Options**:
  - "Yes, check it" (description: "Flag anything that looks contradictory")
  - "No, we're good" (description: "Skip to summary")

If yes:
1. Read the full voice-profile.md
2. Compare the updated SKILL.md sections against the profile
3. Flag any contradictions (e.g., a forbidden pattern that also appears in active patterns, or tone settings that conflict with exemplars)
4. Present findings and offer to fix any issues found

---

## Phase 5: Summary

### Step 1: List changes

Present a clear summary:

> **Changes applied to {PROFILE_NAME}-writer:**
>
> {numbered list of changes with before/after where relevant}

### Step 2: Offer changelog

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Question**: "Want me to add a changelog entry to your voice profile?"
- **Options**:
  - "Yes" (description: "Append a dated entry to voice-profile.md")
  - "No thanks" (description: "Skip the changelog")

If yes, append to voice-profile.md:

```markdown
---

## Changelog

### {TODAY'S DATE}
- {change description}
```

If a Changelog section already exists, append the new entry under it rather than creating a duplicate section.

### Step 3: Wrap up

> Your writer skill has been updated. The changes will apply next time you (or any AI tool) uses the `{PROFILE_NAME}-writer` skill.

---

## Error Handling

- **Path doesn't exist**: Tell the user the path wasn't found and ask them to check it.
- **Missing files**: Explain which file is missing (`SKILL.md` or `voice-profile.md`) and suggest they may need to run `/voiceprint generate` first.
- **Unrecognized structure**: If the files exist but don't follow the expected template structure, warn the user and attempt best-effort edits, noting what couldn't be updated automatically.
- **User wants multiple changes**: Handle them sequentially in a single session — loop through Phase 1-3 for each change, then do a single Phase 5 summary at the end.
