## Core Characteristics

### Tone
{{TONE_DESCRIPTION}}
<!-- Example: "Conversational and direct, with a dry humor that surfaces in asides. Comfortable being opinionated without being aggressive." -->

### Rhythm
{{RHYTHM_DESCRIPTION}}
<!-- Example: "High burstiness - alternates between short, punchy statements and longer flowing sentences. Average sentence length of 14 words with a standard deviation of 8." -->

### Specificity
{{SPECIFICITY_DESCRIPTION}}
<!-- Example: "Concrete and example-driven. Reaches for specific numbers and scenarios rather than abstract claims. When explaining, defaults to 'here's what happened' over 'here's how it works'." -->

## Sentence Structure

### Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average sentence length | {{AVG_SENTENCE_LENGTH}} words |

### Opening Patterns
{{OPENING_PATTERNS}}
<!-- Example: "Tends to open with direct statements or observations. Rarely uses questions as openers. First sentence is often short (5-8 words) followed by a longer elaboration." -->

### Transitions

### Hedging vs Conviction
