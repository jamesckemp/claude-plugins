## Core Characteristics

### Tone
{{TONE_DESCRIPTION}}
<!-- Example: "Conversational and direct, with a dry humor that surfaces in asides. Comfortable being opinionated without being aggressive." -->

### Rhythm
{{RHYTHM_DESCRIPTION}}
<!-- Example: "High burstiness - alternates between short, punchy statements and longer flowing sentences. Average sentence length of 14 words with a standard deviation of 8." -->

### Specificity
{{SPECIFICITY_DESCRIPTION}}
<!-- Example: "Concrete and example-driven. Reaches for specific numbers and scenarios rather than abstract claims. When explaining, defaults to 'here's what happened' over 'here's how it works'." -->

<!-- Example: "High usage of 'just', 'actually', 'honestly'. Moderate use of 'but' as sentence opener. Low usage of formal connectors." -->

### Technical Vocabulary

## Voice Markers

### Personal Context
{{PERSONAL_CONTEXT}}

<!-- Example: "I/my/me: ~4.2% of total words (moderate). 'We' appears more often than 'I' in work contexts." -->

### Hedging vs Conviction
{{HEDGING_PROFILE}}
<!-- Example: "Low hedging. States opinions directly: 'this is wrong' rather than 'I think this might be wrong'. Uses 'I think' occasionally but as genuine uncertainty, not politeness." -->

### Humor & Irony
{{HUMOR_PROFILE}}
<!-- Example: "Dry humor in asides and parentheticals. Occasional deadpan observations. Doesn't use exclamation marks for humor - lets the content do the work." -->

### Emotional Expression
{{EMOTIONAL_PROFILE}}
<!-- Example: "Direct when frustrated - doesn't soften complaints. Enthusiasm shows through specificity (detailed descriptions of what excites them) rather than intensifiers." -->

### Emoji Usage
{{EMOJI_PROFILE}}
<!-- Example: "No emoji in writing. Keeps communication clean of visual markers." -->
